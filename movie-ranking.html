<h1>The Best Movies According To Francis</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2><br/>
<hr/>

<p></p><h3>Paid in full</h3>
"Paid in Full" tells the story of the rise and fall of a gifted young businessman. 
His career might have taken place at Enron, as a talented manager, staging a fake energy crisis to steal from California consumers. 
But opportunity finds us where we live, and Ace lives in Harlem and lacks an MBA, so he becomes a drug dealer. 
The skills involved are much the same as at Enron: Lie to the customers, hide or fake the income, shuffle the books and pay off powerful friends. 
It is useful, in viewing a movie like "Paid in Full," to understand that it is about business, not drugs. Breaking the law is simply an unfortunate side effect of wanting to make more money than can be done legally.</p><br/>

<p><h3>Gerald's Game</h3>
Flanagan's thrilling adaptation shouldn't work, but the director's style, plus Gugino and Greenwood's acting, is never less than captivating. 
The coda works better in hindsight, particularly when it's presented as Jessie's Good For Her moment. </p><br/>

<p><h3>Achrimony</h3>
The movie has enough blinding anger to pull you along, and Perry plays around with one's sympathies by making Henson's character increasingly monstrous, but the pallid dialogue is a constant drag on the story.
